# swiftTicTacToe2
Tic Tac Toe game written in Swift

I've made a Tic Tac Toe game in JavaScript but if I'm honest it was a year ago, and I can't remember for the life of me how I did it. Now,
I've been working with Swift for some time, and this is a great experience in MVC. 

* Right now I have an animation in case of a win for either "Crosses" or "Naughts." I do need one for a draw however. So I need to 
write a state for when that happens, which, we know from WarGames, always happens.
